Writing this half asleep as a reminder of what needs to be done...

Forwarding needs support for lw and sw operations. Most likely by implementing MUX's feeding into DMEM.

Fixed forwarding to not overwrite B input of ALU for I Type instructions

Once LW and SW work with forwarding and at most ONE nop, begin working on hazard control unit
